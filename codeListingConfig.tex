%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% README %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% This is a config file to set:
%   1. Style for listing package (could be use on any language)
%   2. Julia syntax highlighting definition
%   3. Command and environment to insert julia, python, and matlab code in your document easily.
%
%       a. new commands: \juliaFile, \pythonFile, and \matlabFile
%           All three are used like \juliaFile[folder_name]{file_name}
%           folder_name is optional, and do it with the slash, e.g. "myFolder/". When no folder is provided, it is assumed that the code is in the same directory as your document.
%           For file_name, do it without extension (it is assumed).
%       Example:
%           \juliaFile[codes/]{kMeans}
%           \juliaFile{randomForest}
%
%       b. new environments: if you want to write your code directly in your document. juliaText, pythonText, and matlabText are provided. Example:
%           \begin{juliaText}{Write your caption here.}
%           Write your code here
%           \end{juliaText}
