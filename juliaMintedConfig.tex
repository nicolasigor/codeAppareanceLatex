% This is a config file to set:
%   1. Style for minted package, using Julia language as a default.
%   2. A command to insert julia code. Note that to have caption, a floating environment is needed.
%   Example without caption: 
%       \juliaFileMinted{randomForest.jl}
%   Example with float environment:
%
%   \begin{listing}[h!]
%   \caption{My Caption}
%   \label{code:myLabel}
%   \juliaFileMinted{randomForest.jl}
%   \end{listing}
